This is a silly board that does RGB lights.  It's absurdly simple, so I didn't spend ~~much~~ any time on documentation.  If you want all of the good info, go to Blamm!'s Disco on a Stick documentation.  He actually did the work.  I am just copying what he did and putting it in the shape of a Voron logo.  

The only thing you need to know is that they use the WS2812B-V5/W LEDs.
