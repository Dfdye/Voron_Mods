# Voron_Mods

The parts in this repository have been designed for my own use, and not specifically for public release.  As such, they probably contain multiple errors, and are subject to change without notice.  I may not even change file names (sorry!), so please check the suitability of parts for your applicaiton prior to their use.  In some instances I have based designs off of existing parts.  I may have included copies of these parts in my repositories for the sake of convenience, but I have tried to link to the originals and give proper credit whenever I have done so.  If you notice a part that I did not attribute properly, I assure you this this is an oversight and not an attempt to claim anyone's work as my own. Please let me know if you notice where I have failed to properly attribute and I will get that fixed as soon as possible!
